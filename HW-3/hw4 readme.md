This week I focused on fixing my problems from last week (i.e the choices leading nowhere) while also adding on the requirements for this assignment. It was a lot easier than expected, made so by the examples & walk through video. I
find that tutorial videos are much easier for me to comprehend, as I can follow along with each step and verify that my screen or results look the way that they are supposed to.
