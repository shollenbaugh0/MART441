I think my favorite thing about this class, and coding in general, is the sense
of accomplishment I feel when attempting something that actually works how I want it to.
HTML5's features are fun! I think my proudest moment may have been getting my audio
to work properly embedded into the page, using a song from my library. It seems pretty standard, we're used to including images from sources on our computers, but this required
a bit more as it also had to be built into the index properly to be shown / play correctly.
I also spent a bit too much time chasing square 2 with square 1 to see what would happen when they collided/make sure that something actually changed if they collide.
