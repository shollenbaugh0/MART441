#MART441
## Savanah Hollenbaugh

Diving back into coding after a bit of time isn't always smooth sailing.
It's been more than a semester since I've taken MART341, leaving some gaps in
my memory/knowledge. It took quite a bit of refresh and examining code examples
to hop back on the horse and get back into the swing of writing in coding language. Often my frustrations with coding come from the fact that small mistakes (misplaced commas, forgotten end parenthesis) can cause major issues.
I found myself frustrated a few times in this assignment, looking for the specific spots where my coding had gone astray or led into a design I did not want. Eventually, I was able to get myself back into a rhythm of code and problem solving.
