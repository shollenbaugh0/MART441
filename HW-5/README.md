This week's assignment was fun! I actually love how rewarding it is when you implement a coding element exactly the way you were attempting to. Refreshing my index files after pushing my changes on Github and seeing that whatever I just tried to do--actually worked--is so satisfying. It almost makes up for how easy one simple misstep can disrupt your entire flow and setup. But this time, mistakes felt minimal and I feel like I'm finally back into the language.
